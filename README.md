# Flash Loans Swifts

This is a Dapp the connects All the **Defi Developers** that know how to leverage Flash Loans for various purposes and **People** that want to use Flash Loan based contracts for their own but are not familier with the constructs of writing Smart Contract and Solidity programming. 

## Features

- Add Flash Contracts known as **Swifts**
- Deploy and Execute Swifts
- Rate different Swifts based on performance and functionality
- Dashboard for Deployed Swift management

## Working Mechanism for Dapp

Anyone who has written a smart contract for flashloan can submit their smart contract with some of our guidlines, and any user can use them in three simple clicks, without having to worry about how it all is working.
1. We are giving 0.045% fee to the developer of smart contract of the total amount transacted with his contract.
2. We are providing with complete interface for users to deploy their Aave flashloan contract and execute the flashloan and then withdraw assets.
3. We have some guidlines that needs to be followed for submitting the contract, thus to ensure right contract is on our platform.
4. Our platform also has a reputation system, thus more reputed developer's contract will can be identified with ease.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
